#### By _Jeff Dinsmore_

## Description

_This application provides a user to visit Pierre's (virtual) Bakery. As they enter they are welcomed into the bakery and asked if they want to buy any bread. If a user chooses yes, they program will ask how many loaves of bread they want. After the user inputs a number, the program will ask the user if they want to purchase any pastries and how many they want with the same format as the bread questions. After both selections are made, the program will return a price for the total of the items._
